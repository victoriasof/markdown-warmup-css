<p>I will help my teammates learn by teaching.
    I will contribute by maintaining a good team spirit.

<h5>A funny story</h5>
<p>When I finished school I was not sure what to do with my life.
    I was inclined to study IT at a technical institute,
    but my teacher persuaded me to go to shipping university.
    I also tried to get into art school but failed the exam.
    10 years later I am living in Antwerp, making a career switch.
    I am studying web development full time at BeCode,
    as well as painting part-time at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.
</p>

<h6>TL;DR</h6>
<p>It's never too late to start over.
    Searching for my purpose.
